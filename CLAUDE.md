# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Pure Live (纯粹直播) is a Flutter-based third-party live streaming application that supports multiple platforms including Bilibili, Douyu, Huya, Douyin, Kuaishou, CC, and custom M3U8 sources. The app is designed for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and TV platforms.

## Common Commands

### Development Setup
```bash
flutter pub get                    # Install dependencies
flutter clean                     # Clean build artifacts
flutter pub run build_runner build # Generate code
```

### Building and Packaging

#### Android
```bash
flutter build apk                  # Universal APK
flutter build apk --split-per-abi  # Separate APKs for different architectures
```

#### Windows
```bash
dart run msix:create --signtool-options "/td SHA256"  # Windows MSIX package
```

#### iOS/macOS
Requires Xcode for building iOS and macOS versions.

### Code Generation
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs  # Regenerate all generated files
flutter pub run json_serializable   # JSON serialization
flutter pub run protoc_builder      # Protocol buffer generation
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons  # Update app icons
```

### Localization
```bash
flutter pub run intl_utils:generate  # Generate localization files
```

### Linting
The project uses `flutter_lints` package with configuration in `analysis_options.yaml`.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Structure
- **`lib/core/`**: Core business logic and platform integrations
  - `site/`: Platform-specific implementations (Bilibili, Douyu, Huya, etc.)
  - `danmaku/`: Danmaku (live chat) handling for each platform
  - `interface/`: Abstract interfaces for live sites and danmaku
  - `iptv/`: M3U8 playlist parsing and IPTV support
  - `common/`: Shared utilities and helpers

- **`lib/common/`**: Shared application components
  - `services/`: Global services (Settings, Authentication, etc.)
  - `widgets/`: Reusable UI components
  - `models/`: Data models and structures
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
  - `l10n/`: Internationalization support (Chinese/English)

- **`lib/modules/`**: Feature modules organized by functionality
  - Each module typically contains: `*_page.dart`, `*_controller.dart`, `*_binding.dart`
  - Major modules: `live_play/`, `areas/`, `settings/`, `account/`, `search/`

### State Management
The application uses **GetX** for state management, routing, and dependency injection:
- Controllers extend `BaseController` from `lib/common/base/base_controller.dart`
- Services are initialized in `main.dart` using `Get.put()`
- Bindings are used for lazy loading of controllers

### Platform Support
- **Android/TV**: MPV Player via media_kit (single kernel)
- **Windows**: Media Kit for video playback, Windows-specific utilities
- **Mobile**: Touch-optimized UI with gestures and mobile-specific features
- **Cross-platform**: SharedPreferences for settings, file system access

### Live Streaming Integration
Each streaming platform has its own implementation in `lib/core/site/`:
- `LiveSite` interface defines common methods for all platforms
- Platform-specific classes handle API calls, authentication, and stream URL extraction
- Danmaku systems are separate implementations per platform
- Support for custom M3U8 playlists through IPTV functionality

### Key Features
- Multi-platform live streaming support
- Real-time danmaku (live chat) with filtering and merging
- User authentication via Supabase
- WebDAV backup/restore functionality  
- Custom M3U8 playlist imports
- Platform-specific optimizations and player selection
- Internationalization (Chinese/English)
- Theme customization with dynamic colors

### Dependencies and Services
- **Media playback**: `media_kit` for cross-platform video
- **Network**: `dio` for HTTP requests with cookie management
- **Database**: `supabase_flutter` for user authentication and data
- **UI framework**: Flutter with Material Design and custom theming
- **Storage**: `shared_preferences` for app settings, file system for caching

## Development Notes

### Platform-Specific Code
- Windows initialization includes window management and single-instance checking
- Android handles share intents for M3U8 file imports  
- Platform-specific video player selection based on capabilities

### Build Configuration
- Uses Flutter Version Manager (FVM) - see `.fvmrc`
- MSIX configuration for Windows Store deployment
- Custom app icons and launcher configurations
- Localization files auto-generated in `lib/common/l10n/generated/`

### Testing and Quality
- Uses `flutter_lints` for code quality
- Excludes generated files from analysis
- Protocol buffer definitions for platform-specific messaging
